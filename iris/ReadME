The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald
Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.It is sometimes called Anderson's 
Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic 
variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
